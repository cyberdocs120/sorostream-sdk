/**
 * Generic in-flight request deduplication (issue #426).
 *
 * Dashboards routinely mount several components that all need the same stream
 * at the same time. Without deduplication each component issues its own RPC
 * call for the same data, multiplying latency and RPC quota usage for zero
 * benefit. `RequestDeduplicator` collapses concurrent calls that share a key
 * into a single underlying request: the first caller starts the work, every
 * caller that arrives while it is still in flight joins the same promise.
 *
 * Semantics:
 * - The in-flight entry is registered **synchronously**, before the factory's
 *   first `await` yields, so callers created in the same tick always join.
 * - The entry is removed as soon as the request settles — successfully or not.
 *   Failures are therefore never cached and the next caller retries.
 * - Every joined caller observes the *same* resolved value (or rejection),
 *   which keeps concurrent readers consistent with each other.
